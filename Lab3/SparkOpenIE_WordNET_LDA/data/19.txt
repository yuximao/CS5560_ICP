Mitochondria are essential organelles that act in pathways including ATP production, Î²-oxidation, and clearance of reactive oxygen species. They occur as a complex reticular network that constantly undergoes fusion and fission, mediated by dynamin-related proteins (DRPs). DRPs include Fzo1, which mediates fusion, and Dnm1, Mdv1, and Fis1, which mediate fission. Mitochondrial morphology has been implicated in virulence in multiple fungi, as with the association between virulence and increased mitochondrial fusion in
