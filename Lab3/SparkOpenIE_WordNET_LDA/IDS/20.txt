Modeling thousands of markers simultaneously has been of great interest in testing association between genetic biomarkers and disease or disease-related quantitative traits. Recently, an expectation-maximization (EM) approach to Bayesian variable selection (EMVS) facilitating the Bayesian computation was developed for continuous or binary outcome using a fast EM algorithm. However, it is not suitable to the analyses of time-to-event outcome in many public databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
