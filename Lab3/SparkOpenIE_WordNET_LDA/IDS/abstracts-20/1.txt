Mucopolysaccharydosis IIIB is the second most frequent form of Sanfilippo syndrome, a degenerative, pediatric lysosomal storage disease (LSD) characterized by severe neurological disorders and death. We have generated two iPSCs lines derived from dermal fibroblast from a MPSIIIB homozygous (P358L) donor. Cells were reprogrammed with OriP/EBNA1-based episomal plasmids containing: OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, L-MYC, LIN28, BCL-xL and shp53. Both cell lines are homozygous for the P358L mutation of the α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) gene, have normal karyotype, are free of plasmid integration, express high levels of pluripotency-associated markers and can differentiate into the three germ layers. RESOURCE TABLE: RESOURCE UTILITY: Although the generation of iPSCs has been reported for some lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) in general, and from other mutations of the NAGLU gene in particular (Lemonnier et al., 2011), this is the first time that NAGLU Pro358Leu MPSIIIB-iPSCs lines have been generated and fully characterized demonstrating their quality as iPS cells. RESOURCE DETAILS: Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (MPSIII, Sanfilippo syndrome type B) is a pediatric neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency in NAGLU, an enzyme required for lysosomal degradation of heparin sulphate (HS). When the enzyme is absent or malfunctioning, HS accumulates in the cells of several tissues, with devastating effects in the brain and central nervous system. MPSIIIB is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and presents an incidence between 0.03 and 0.78 cases per 1 × 10
