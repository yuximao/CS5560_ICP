In order to develop a secure and competent technique to express the human immune gene for fighting infections, we cloned and expressed the BD2/3 using VR1020 (a eukaryotic expression plasmid). BD2/3 contains human Î²-defensin 2 (BD2) and human BD3. To explore safe and effective DNA delivery molecules
