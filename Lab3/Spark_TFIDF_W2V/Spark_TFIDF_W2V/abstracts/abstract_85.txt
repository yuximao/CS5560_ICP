Assessment of cognitive function in people with neurosychiatric disorders can be challenging, due to behavioural and psychiatric symptomatology. The Behavioural Assesment Tool for Cognition and Higher Functioning (BATCH) is a validated observational tool that complements formal cognitive testing in this patient population. This study aimed to determine the capacity of the BATCH as a predictive tool for discharge planning.
