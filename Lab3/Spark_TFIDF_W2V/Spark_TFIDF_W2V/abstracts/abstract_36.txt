Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), pica, and rumination disorder (RD) were added to the revised DSM-5 Feeding and Eating Disorders chapter in 2013. We developed a structured interview-the Pica, ARFID, and Rumination Disorder Interview (PARDI)-to assess the presence and severity of these diagnoses for evaluation and treatment planning in clinical and research settings. Here, we describe the development of the PARDI and provide a preliminary report on feasibility, acceptability, reliability, and validity in relation to ARFID.
