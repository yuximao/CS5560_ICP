Cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3) is a membrane-bound NADH-dependent redox enzyme anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane. Recessive hereditary methaemoglobinaemia (RHM) type II is caused by CYB5R3 deficiency and is an incurable disease characterized by severe encephalopathy with mental retardation, microcephaly, generalized dystonia, and movement disorders. Currently, the etiology of type II RHM is poorly understood and there is no treatment for encephalopathy associated with this disease. Defective CYB5R3 leads to defects in the elongation and desaturation of fatty acids and cholesterol biosynthesis, which are conventionally linked with neurological disorders of type II RHM. Nevertheless, this abnormal lipid metabolism cannot explain all manifestations observed in patients. Current molecular and cellular studies indicate that CYB5R3 deficiency has pleiotropic tissue effects. Its localization in lipid rafts of neurons indicates its role in interneuronal contacts and its presence in caveolae of the vascular endothelial membrane suggests a role in the modulation of nitric oxide diffusion. Its role in aerobic metabolism and oxidative stress in fibroblasts, neurons, and cardiomyocytes has been reported to be due to its ability to modulate the intracellular ratio of NAD‚Å∫/NADH. Based on the new molecular and cellular functions discovered for CYB5R3 linked to the plasma membrane and mitochondria, the conventional conception that the cause of type II RHM is a lipid metabolism disorder should be revised. We hypothesized that neurological symptoms of the disease could be caused by disorders in the synapse, aerobic metabolism, and/or vascular homeostasis rather than in disturbances of lipid metabolism.
