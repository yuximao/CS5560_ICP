Variation between homeless populations due to socioeconomic and environmental factors necessitates tailoring medical, health policy, and public health interventions to the unique needs of the homeless population served. Despite the relatively large size of the homeless population in Florida, there is a paucity of research that characterizes the homeless population who frequent homeless clinics within the state. This project describes the demographics, disease prevalence, and other risk factors among homeless individuals in Tampa, Florida. We conducted a retrospective chart review on adult homeless patients seen in 2015 and 2016 at two free clinic sites operated by Tampa Bay Street Medicine, a medical student-run organization from the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida. Rates of diseases and substance use were recorded and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated to assess mortality risk. Of the 183 homeless patients in this study, 34.4% reported hypertension, 13.7% reported diabetes, 27.1% reported a respiratory disease, 5.6% reported hyperlipidemia, and 32.8% reported a psychiatric disorder. Tobacco use was reported by 65.6% of patients, 32.2% reported alcohol use, and 17.5% reported illicit drug use. CCI was positively associated with age. Females reported higher rates of anemia, anxiety, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and psychiatric disorders. Hypertension, diabetes, certain respiratory diseases, and mental health disorders were more prevalent in the homeless population than in the general population in Tampa, Florida. Homeless women appeared to have higher morbidity than homeless men. Rates of tobacco and illicit drug use were significantly higher whereas alcohol use was lower in the study population than the general population. This study underscores the critical need for mental health initiatives, substance abuse treatment programs, and women's health programs that are accessible to the homeless in Tampa.
