Early intervention psychiatric services for patients with psychosis aim to limit the most damaging outcomes and reduce the patient's risk of social drift, decreasing illness severity and thus containing healthcare costs. There is a scarcity of studies that focus on first-episode psychosis (FEP), and those few that have been published only looked at direct health costs, but not at indirect costs, which make up the bulk of the budget. Our study aims to explore the short-term (1-year follow-up) economic cost of a FEP Program, including both direct and indirect costs.
