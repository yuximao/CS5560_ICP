The clinical high-risk state in psychosis is most often characterized by subthreshold psychotic symptoms (STPS) and represents a target for psychosis prevention. However, evidence suggests that between 30% and 50% of patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) report no prior history of STPS, indicating that not all patients with FEP experience a previous clinical high-risk phase. As with other early characteristics of illness onset, this diversity in the early course of symptoms may offer prognostic value for subsequent clinical trajectories.
