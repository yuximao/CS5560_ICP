Sex differences are a prominent feature of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder which affects women at a higher incidence than men. Research suggests that the most potent endogenous estrogen, 17β-estradiol, may have therapeutic potential in treating depression. However, preclinical studies have produced mixed results, likely due to various methodological factors such as treatment duration. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ovariectomy and chronic 17β-estradiol treatment via a subcutaneous silastic implant on behaviours relevant to depression in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were assessed in the forced swim test, saccharin preference test, novel object recognition memory test and for possible confounding behaviours, including locomotion and anxiety (open field test) and motivation and anxiety (novelty supressed feeding test). Treatment effects were verified using body and uterus weight, as well as serum concentrations of 17β-estradiol, progesterone and testosterone. Compared to ovariectomised rats, chronic 17β-estradiol treatment enhanced saccharin preference and novel object recognition performance. There were no group differences in passive or active coping behaviour when assayed using the forced swim test. Taken together, these results support an antidepressant-like action of estrogens but highlight that the beneficial effects of chronic 17β-estradiol treatment may be related to specific depression-related symptoms, particularly anhedonia and memory.
