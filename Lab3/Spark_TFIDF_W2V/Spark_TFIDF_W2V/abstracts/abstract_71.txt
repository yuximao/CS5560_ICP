Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications are biochemical alterations of the DNA or its spatial structure. They regulate gene function, can be modified by environmental influences and are temporally dynamic. In this review, the current state of knowledge regarding the role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of mental disorders is summarized exemplarily for schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder. Additionally, findings on epigenetic alterations in the course of pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic interventions are presented. Epigenetic mechanisms have a central function at the crossroads between genes and environment and consequently in the vulnerability-stress model of mental disorders. Prospectively, in line with a precision medicine approach epigenetic profiles may represent useful markers of disease risk and therapy response or even constitute new druggable targets.
