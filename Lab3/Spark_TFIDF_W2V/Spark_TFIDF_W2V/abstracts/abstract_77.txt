Recent advances in statistical methods and computing power have improved the ability to predict risks associated with mental illness with more efficiency and accuracy. However, integrating statistical prediction into a clinical setting poses new challenges that need creative solutions. A case example explores the challenges and innovations that emerged at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital while implementing REACH VET (Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health-Veterans Enhanced Treatment), a suicide prevention program that is based on a predictive model that identifies veterans at statistical risk for suicide.
