For a number of mental health disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), there are not many available treatment options. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the potential of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) to restore function for patients with these disorders. The primary hypothesis is that MDMA, via prosocial effects, increases the ability of patients to address the underlying psychopathology of the disorder. However, the use of MDMA poses potential problems of neurotoxicity, in addition to its own potential for misuse.
