Health-based electronic games present an innovative tool to deal with mental and behavioral disorders as well as physical. An appropriately designed game can optimize health care. The aim of this study was to establish a design for health-based electronic games model and to develop a sample game in diabetes. This study was carried out in two phases: first, the design of a health-based electronic game framework and second, the design and production of sweet care game. There were two intended information prerequisites: determination of effective components in models of behavior change and validation of these components on health topics and structural formation of a game. The game framework design was presented. In the second phase, a sample of the game was developed in the field of diabetes. Important components to empower people were ranked using the Friedman test in the following order: self-learning, treatment, mental empowerment, condition management, healthy eating and physical activity. The axis of self-learning received the highest rating from the perspective of the subjects with an average of 3.93 percent. Another part was the game framework with components as follows: application areas, educational content for change behavior, resources, game structure and game production. Finally, the sweet care game was designed on diabetes with educational, technological and clinical content. The health-based electronic game designed on a systematic framework could be applied as a tool to expanding the knowledge base on how to create effective health-based digital games that entertain while promoting behavior change.
