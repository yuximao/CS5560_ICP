N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a clinically approved thiol-containing redox modulatory compound currently in trials for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although generically labeled as an "antioxidant", poor understanding of its site(s) of action is a barrier to its use in neurological practice. Here, we examined the efficacy and mechanism of action of NAC in rodent models of hemorrhagic stroke.
