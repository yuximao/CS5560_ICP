Endoscopic screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is performed at longer time intervals than the fecal occult blood test or screens for breast or prostate cancer. This causes concerns about interval cancers, which have been proposed to progress more rapidly. We compared outcomes of patients with interval CRCs after sigmoidoscopy screening vs outcomes of patients with CRC who had not been screened.
