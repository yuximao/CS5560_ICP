Breast cancer is the most common threat in women worldwide. Increasing death rate of diagnosed cases is the main leading cause of designing specific immunoassay for tumor marker in breast cancer. Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) is a tumor protein for many types of cancer, most notably breast cancer. Herein, we report a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor based on signal amplification strategy of multiple nanocomposites to detection of CA 15-3 biomarker. The proposed immunosensor fabricated by reduced graphene oxide (rGO), poly-dopamine (PDA) and amino functionalized mesoporous silica (MCM-41-NH
