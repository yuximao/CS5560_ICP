Brain metastasis remains a major cause of death in patients with solid cancers. The co-operation between several molecular factors such as chemokines, chemokine receptors, and signaling pathways is involved in the pathogenesis of brain metastasis mostly from solid tumors. In this review, we examine the possible role of chemokine/receptor axis, as well as signaling pathways as prognostic biomarkers in brain metastasis.
