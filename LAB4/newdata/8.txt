Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cause of brain metastasis in the United States. Compared to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), treatment with gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS) offers a better chance at neurocognitive preservation. The goal of our retrospective study is to report the overall survival (OS) in patients receiving GKRS and to identify factors that improve survival outcomes.
