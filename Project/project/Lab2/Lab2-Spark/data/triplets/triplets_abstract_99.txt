subcallosal cingulate	deep stimulation of be	emerge experimental therapy for treatment-resistant depression
New development	identify	specific axonal pathway
we	therefore use	most detailed patient-specific foundation for DBS modeling currently available
activation	be in	scc region
regressor	be in	linear model predict
left cb	stimulation of be	most likely therapeutic target for scc db
recovery process	activation beyond	critical percentage
