pathogenesis	be mediate through	infiltration of perivascular macrophage into brain with secretion of viral protein
cocaine	further potentiate and	catb neurotoxicity
modulation	increase	oxidative species
catb secretion	be in	macrophage expose to cocaine
pharmacological modulation	alter and	catb secretion from hiv-1 infected macrophage
hiv-1 seronegative donor	from derived-macrophage be	mdm
