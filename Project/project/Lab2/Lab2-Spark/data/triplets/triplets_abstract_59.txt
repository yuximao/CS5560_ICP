therapy	be	effective
we	explore	effect of ECT on functional connectivity of brain hub in depression patient
depression patient	be	in current study assess at three time point
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging	assessment of	clinical symptom
functional connectivity strength	identify	brain hub
fcs	significantly increase after	ECT
change fcs	recover obviously at	1 month after completion of ECT
ECT	modulate	functional connectivity of left angular gyrus
