lithium	be	mainstay treatment in bipolar disorder for its effectiveness in acute phase of illness in prevention of recurrence
lithium	have	mechanism of action
we	apply	integrate analytical approach
we	test	effect of treatment with lithium chloride 1 mm on transcriptome of lymphoblast
finding	be integrate with	gene-based analysis on genome-wide genotyping datum from extended sample of 205 bd patient characterize for lithium response
lithium	be in	LR
validation	be with	quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
we	use	convergent analysis of genome-wide expression
first evidence	support	involvement of zinc finger protein in lithium response
