A high number of patients with mental health disorders currently do not receive minimally adequate treatment, but remain solely in general practice. This is often due to long waiting times for psychotherapy, patient related barriers or diagnostic insecurity. For this reason, we have developed a care model that is applied directly in the general practitioner's (GP) office and is open to any form of psychosomatic disorder. The cornerstone of the model consists of a psychosomatic specialist consultation in the GP's office. Preliminary results concerning utilization and the target population show a high level of acceptance among patients, GPs, and psychosomatic specialists.
