Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) is an emerging experimental therapy for treatment-resistant depression. New developments in SCC DBS surgical targeting are focused on identifying specific axonal pathways for stimulation that are estimated from patient-specific computational models. This connectomic-based biophysical modeling strategy has proven successful in improving the clinical response to SCC DBS therapy, but the DBS models used to date have been relatively simplistic, limiting the precision of the pathway activation estimates. Therefore, we used the most detailed patient-specific foundation for DBS modeling currently available (i.e., field-cable modeling) to evaluate SCC DBS in our most recent cohort of six subjects, all of which were responders to the therapy. We quantified activation of four major pathways in the SCC region: forceps minor (FM), cingulum bundle (CB), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and subcortical connections between the frontal pole and the thalamus or ventral striatum (FP). We then used the percentage of activated axons in each pathway as regressors in a linear model to predict the time it took patients to reach a stable response, or TSR. Our analysis suggests that stimulation of the left and right CBs, as well as FM are the most likely therapeutic targets for SCC DBS. In addition, the right CB alone predicted 84% of the variation in the TSR, and the correlation was positive, suggesting that activation of the right CB beyond a critical percentage may actually protract the recovery process.
