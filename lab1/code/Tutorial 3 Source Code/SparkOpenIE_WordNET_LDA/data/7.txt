Past trials of buprenorphine (BUP) in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) have displayed favorable results, although its clinical utility was limited by the risk of abuse or physical dependence. By combining BUP with samidorphan (SAM), the euphoric high is negated by an opposing mechanism, which theoretically reduces addictive-like properties while allowing the antidepressant properties to remain. As such, the objective of this article is to analyze the results of BUP/SAM premarketing clinical trials as adjunctive treatment for treatment-resistant MDD.
