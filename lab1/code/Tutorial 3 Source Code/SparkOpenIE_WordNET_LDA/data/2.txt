Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global public health concern. In particular, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) represents a key unmet need in the management of MDD. A systematic review of the epidemiological and economic literature on the burden associated with an increasing number of treatment steps due to TRD/non-response within an MDD episode was performed to quantify the burden of TRD.
