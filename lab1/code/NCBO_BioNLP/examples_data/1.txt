The outcome of local treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poor, with therapies such as induction chemotherapy (IC) yielding conflicting results. This study aimed to assess the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), beclin-1, and glucose-regulated protein of molecular mass 78 (GRP78) in patients with locally advanced NSCLC receiving docetaxel-platinum IC, along with efficacy and safety.
